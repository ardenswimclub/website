**We are excited to welcome your swimmers and families to Arden\!\!**

## Arrival

Your team is welcome to arrive anytime after 4:45pm.

## Parking 

Our pool is located off of Harvey Rd. We will try to have volunteers directing traffic. Handicap parking will be available in our paved parking lot. All other parking is in the field across the street. It's a very short walk.

There is a grassy area with lounge chairs and a concrete pad with picnic tables and 
umbrellas. You will be near our fenced baby pool area. We ask that the baby pool
