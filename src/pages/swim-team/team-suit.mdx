# Team Suit

  Arden proudly supports a local business for swim team bathing suits. 
For over 35 years, The Swim Shop has been serving local swim teams 
in the tri-state area. As a family-run business, they are known for
 their excellent customer service and commitment to the community. 
 You can trust the quality of the products they sell, and they are 
 very knowledgeable about everything they offer. Stop in to have 
 your child measured for the best fit.

**We highly recommend visiting the shop to try on your suit before purchasing**
