## 🔐 Bonds

Bonds are **no longer required** and **no longer sold** for new members.  

If you already hold a bond in good standing, your bondholder discount **will still be honored**.

## 🚫 Day Passes

Due to changes in our insurance policy, **walk-up day passes are no longer available**.

## NO Half Price / Half Season Memberships

In past years, we offered half-price pool memberships beginning July 15 through the end of the summer season. As announced last season, because many of our operating expenses occur at the start of the summer and we need confirmed membership numbers to properly plan and budget, we will no longer be offering mid-season discounted memberships. 

We appreciate your understanding as we work to manage costs responsibly and maintain a high-quality experience for all members.

## Guest Policy

Members are welcome to bring guests!  
Before entering the pool area, **members must sign in their guests at the entrance**.  
All guests must be **accompanied by a current Arden Swim Club member**.

- **Guest fee:** $5 per guest, ages 3 and up  
- Each local individual may be signed in as a guest **up to six times per summer season**
