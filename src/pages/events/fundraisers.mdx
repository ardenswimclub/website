## 🩷 Fundraisers & Community Support

Our community pool relies on the generosity and involvement of our members and
neighbors to help maintain and improve our facilities. Throughout the year, we
host a variety of fun fundraisers that bring the community together:

* **Valentine’s Day Pancake Breakfast** – Every February, join us for a delicious
pancake breakfast featuring locally sourced sausage from Halda’s Meat Market.

* **Egg My Yard Fundraiser** –  In the spring, we “magically” deliver eggs filled
with candy and small toys to your yard the evening before Easter.

* **Sharks Swim Team Car Washes** – The Arden Sharks host two car washes each 
year at Foulk Road Auto, on the corner of Foulk and Silverside Road.

We are always exploring new and creative ways to fundraise, build partnerships,
and strengthen our community while supporting the pool. Your participation 
helps keep our pool safe, welcoming, and enjoyable for everyone!
