# Swim Meet Volunteer Positions

Listed below is a brief description of the volunteer positions that need to be filled for every meet. None of the jobs are especially difficult and simple training is provided as needed; however, some of the positions do require attending special training sessions and some positions are better suited for our more experienced swim parents. If you are brand new to the swim team, the jobs of timer, runner, set up, take down and concessions are good places to start out volunteering. 

## ANNOUNCER

Announces first, second and final calls for each event. Works closely with the starter to keep the meet running smoothly. The announcer will need to anticipate flow based on the number of swimmers, the stroke, the number of lengths to be swum, and the age of the swimmers. Training or previous experience is required for this position. **Home meets only.** 

## STARTER

Starts each event with the announcement of the age and stroke and the words 
"SWIMMERS TAKE YOUR MARK", pauses to make sure that all swimmers are 
motionless, and then gives an electronic sound or a blast of a whistle. 
He/She shall be the sole judge of FALSE STARTS and all false starts shall
be restarted. Must attend a training clinic at the beginning of each season
 in order to volunteer in this position. **Home meets only.**

## STROKE & TURN JUDGE

The stroke and turn judge will monitor half of the lanes to ensure swimmers perform the strokes correctly and execute proper turns at the wall. They will walk along the side of the pool to maintain visibility, ensuring swimmers follow race rules for fairness and safety while helping them learn and improve. This person will use the app *Swimmingly* on their smartphone during this role. To volunteer, you must attend a training clinic at the beginning of each season. **Home and away meets.**

## TIMERS

Timers use their smartphones and the app *Swimmingly* to time swimmers. The stopwatch on your phone will start automatically, and all you need to do is hit stop when the swimmer in your lane touches the wall. After that, simply type in the swimmerâ€™s three-digit number and click save. Each swimmer will have their number written on their arm in Sharpie before the meet, or they can tell it to you as they climb out of the pool. This job gives you the best view of the pool and the swimmers during their races. Warning, you might get wet.  **Home and away meets.**

## BULLPEN

Supervises the waiting area during meets, keeps track of swimmers \- as best as they reasonably can \- between events, and gets swimmers to the ready bench on time with caps and goggles. Ideally several parents will share this job. This position is obviously more important for the younger swimmers, but all swimmers benefit from this volunteer. This job keeps you with your swimmer during the entire meet. **Home and away meets.**

## PLACE JUDGE

 This role involves determining 1st through 3rd place finishes and resolving any disputes about swimmer placement. Itâ€™s especially important in case there is an issue with the timing system. **Home and away meets.**

## RUNNER

 Responsible for obtaining the completed cards for each race from the place judges and delivered to the scoring table. The job title is very descriptive. Runners should have good shoes that work well on slippery wet surfaces. This job keeps you moving around at the poolside and the time passes quickly. **Home meets only.** 

## SCOREKEEPER

 The Scorekeeper manages and updates race results in real-time using the *Swimmingly* app on a tablet provided by the pool. This role includes recording times, handling disqualifications, and ensuring the accurate placement of swimmers. The Scorekeeper sits poolsideâ€”ideally near the starterâ€”for clear communication, a good view of the races, and collaboration with a representative from the opposing team. **Home and away meets.**

## RIBBONS

Assist in printing labels in real time from the judges' tent, where the scorekeepers are stationed. Labels are placed on ribbons, which are then sorted and filed into swimmer folders. This role keeps you seated and out of the sun, but may require you to continue working briefly after the meet ends to ensure all ribbons are processed and filed correctly. **Home meets only.**

## CONCESSIONS

 Concession volunteers play a key role in creating a fun and welcoming atmosphere at our meets. Responsibilities include setting up and tearing down the concession stand, helping to organize and display food and drinks, and selling items to swimmers, families, and spectators throughout the event. This is a great way to stay involved during the meet, interact with the community, and help raise funds that support the swim club. Volunteers should be comfortable handling money and working in a fast-paced, social environment. **Home meets only.**
