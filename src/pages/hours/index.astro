<strong>Why?</strong><br/>
The pool is usually open 3‚Äì8 PM. Last year, we closed early for setup. 
This year, we were asked to close by 3 PM. While opening from 12‚Äì3 PM was considered, 
limited lifeguard availability due to school starting led us to decide that remaining 
closed all day was the most practical choice.</p>
