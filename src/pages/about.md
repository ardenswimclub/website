# About Us

The Arden Swim Club is managed by a Board of dedicated volunteers who work year-round with community members to raise funds for the improvement and repair of the pool.

The board’s mission is to create a welcoming, inclusive space where families and individuals can connect, relax, and enjoy the benefits of the pool.
