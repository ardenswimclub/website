# Declare Your Swimmer

## What Does It Mean to Declare Your Swimmer as "Attending" or "Not Attending"?

Before each swim meet, parents are asked to declare whether their swimmer will be attending or not attending the meet. This is done through the Swimmingly app or website.

Declaring your swimmer helps coaches plan the meetâ€”such as organizing relays and assigning swimmers to events. Even if your child cannot attend, it's important to mark them as "not attending" so the team can be properly organized.

Please try to declare your swimmer by the deadline listed for each meet. It helps everything run smoothly for coaches, swimmers, and volunteers\!
