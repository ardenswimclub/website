# Welcome to Summer Swim with the Arden Swim Team\!

The Arden Swim Club offers an exciting summer swim team and is a proud member of the North Brandywine Swim League (NBSL). Our team provides a fun, competitive, and supportive environment for all children of our members. Our goal is to improve physical health, build positive self-esteem, and foster dedication and teamwork in every swimmer.

We aim to create a strong, supportive team environment where swimmers build friendships and cheer each other on. To help foster this sense of connection, we ask that athletes refrain from using electronics during practices and meets. Instead, we encourage swimmers to be present—supporting teammates, celebrating successes, and staying fully engaged in the team experience.

## Eligibility & Registration:

In order to participate in the Arden Sharks Swim Team, swimmers must be members of the Arden Swim Club and 18 years of age or younger as of June 1\. To participate in a swim meet, swimmers must be able to swim one lap unassisted—on their stomach or back. All swimmers must also be registered via *Swimmingly* prior to attending their first practice.

We welcome children of all skill levels—from those who are just learning to swim to those who compete year-round. Our coaching staff works closely with beginner swimmers to help them feel safe, confident, and excited about swimming. At the same time, our experienced athletes continue to grow and challenge themselves in a supportive and competitive environment.

Our summer swim team program is designed to help each child grow physically, mentally, and emotionally in a safe and caring space, while making sure they feel supported and encouraged every step of the way. We strive to bring out the best in every swimmer, helping them develop valuable skills both in and out of the pool.
