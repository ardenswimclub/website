**The Arden Fair** is a beloved annual tradition held on the Saturday of Labor Day weekend in the historic village of Arden. Featuring handmade crafts, live music, food vendors, and family-friendly activities, the fair draws thousands of visitors and transforms the village into a bustling pedestrian zone for the day.

Because of the fair, the **Arden Swim Club parking lot will be closed to all vehicles** on Fair Day. But don't worry — getting to the pool is still easy!

## 🚐 Free Off-Site Parking & Shuttle Service

We’ve arranged free parking at the YMCA Hanby Outdoor Center, located at:

📍 [35 Chestnut St, Wilmington, DE 19810](https://maps.app.goo.gl/YKuv1keSnuZkxjjt5)

Shuttle buses will run every few minutes between the parking area and the Arden Swim Club throughout the day.

## ♿ Accessibility

Guests with disabilities may be dropped off at the Orleans bus stop (located near the pool entrance), but all vehicles must be parked off-site at the Hanby Center after drop-off.

We appreciate your understanding and cooperation. Enjoy the Fair — and don’t forget your towel!
